EventListener

EventListener is a web application inspired by EventBrite built using Ruby on Rails and React/Redux. By the end of Week 9, this app will, at a minimum, satisfy the following criteria with smooth, bug-free navigation, adequate seed data and sufficient CSS styling:

  1. New account creation, login, and guest/demo login
  2. A production README, replacing this README (NB: check out the  sample production README -- you'll write this later)
  3. Hosting on Heroku
  4. Events
  5. Registration / Tickets
  6. Categories
  7. Bookmark events

  8. Bonus: Google Maps integration
  9. Bonus: Search
